### Summary

#### Business Context

It would be helpful if the app could provide an easy way for members to access and review the information they used when signing up. This would allow them to double-check the accuracy of their details and ensure that their account information is up-to-date.

#### In Scope

- Add a component that displays the member's details on the accounts page
- Displays the member's full name, email and Avios balance
- The component is tested

#### Out of Scope

- Displaying any other information about the member not mentioned above.

---

### Assumptions

- Member details are added to the Redux state when they log in.
