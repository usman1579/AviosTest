# Tasks

Thank you for participating in our technical test.

Your first task is to run the app on your computer. Please follow the instructions in the main Readme.

We have provided two tasks for you to complete, and you can do them in any order:

- On the home screen, add the member's first name and Avios balance, and create a button that takes the member to the account screen.
- On the account screen, add the member's details.

Each task comes with specific instructions. If there is a design, we have provided it, but if there isn't one, feel free to get creative with the look and feel.

Additionally, there is a broken test that you can attempt to fix if you have time.

Tasks:

- [Home Screen Welcome](./home-screen-welcome.md)
- [Account Screen Member Details](./account-screen-member-details.md)
